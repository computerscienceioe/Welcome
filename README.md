# Welcome

Sup my dudes if you actually joined this then you're probably doing computer science for leaving cert in the IOE

How this works:
1. I upload python lessons after they're done in this team
2. If you see a code thats incomplete or wrong, please consider fixing it yourself
3. Real Time collaboration is on the repl team that i made, if you want the link, dm me on ig.
4. If you cant see any of the code here, dm me and i'll send you an invite.



enjoy your stay!
