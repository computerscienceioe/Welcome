# Welcome
Sup my dudes if you actually joined this then you're probably doing computer science for leaving cert in the IOE

How this works:
=> I upload python lessons after they're done in this team
=> If you see a code thats incomplete or wrong, please consider fixing it yourself
=> Real Time collaboration is on the repl team that i made, if you want the link, dm me on ig.
=> Most importantly, dont tell the teachers.



enjoy your stay!
